# Deep Learning Project: Meta AI DETR Model with ResNet-50 Backbone

This project explores the **DETR (DEtection TRansformer)** model developed by Meta AI, utilizing a **ResNet-50** backbone. The DETR model is designed for end-to-end object detection, based on the paper titled “End-to-End Object Detection with Transformers” by Nicolas Carion, Francisco Massa, Gabriel Synnaeve, Nicolas Usunier, Alexander Kirillov, and Sergey Zagoruyko. The model is trained on the **Common Objects in Context (COCO) 2017** object detection dataset, containing 118k annotated images.

- **Model Architecture**: The DETR model combines a convolutional backbone network (ResNet-50) with a Transformer-based encoder-decoder architecture to detect objects in an image without using traditional methods like non-maximum suppression.

## Exploration Objectives

The main goal of this project is to explore the capabilities of the DETR model by testing it on three unseen datasets. The exploration will involve:

1. **Evaluating an Untrained Model**: Test the DETR model’s ability to make predictions on new datasets without any prior training.
2. **Training the Model Manually**: Train the DETR model on three new datasets and evaluate its performance.
3. **Exploring Image Augmentation Techniques**: Apply various image augmentation techniques to understand their effect on model performance.
4. **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Adjust hyperparameters like learning rate, batch size, and optimizer settings to analyze their impact on the model's results.

## Datasets

The following datasets will be used to test the model's ability to generalize to new contexts:

1. **Animals Dataset**: A collection of images featuring various animal species.

2. **Traffic Dataset**: Images of road traffic scenes, including different vehicles and traffic signs.

3. **Football Dataset**: Images of football players in different game scenarios.

## Implementation Plan

- **Load the DETR Model**: Use the pre-trained DETR model with the ResNet-50 backbone from the Hugging Face Model Hub.
- **Dataset Preparation**: Preprocess the datasets (animals, traffic, football) and apply relevant data augmentation techniques.
- **Training**: Fine-tune the DETR model on the new datasets, using various hyperparameter settings to optimize performance.
- **Evaluation**: Assess the model’s performance using standard metrics (e.g., mAP, precision, recall) and compare results across datasets and training conditions.
- **Analysis**: Document the impact of different hyperparameters and augmentation techniques on the model's effectiveness.
